# Risk-Methodology-Assessment
The objective of RMA is to identify and assess risks in a clinical study, which can be minimized by monitoring activities

    It is therefore necessary to identify and assess risks that are directly related to the responsibilities during study monitoring

    In order to decide which risks are greatest in a study and thus should have significant influence on the monitoring planning, each risk must be examined in terms of:

        What is the potential impact on the study. Here, the points listed in ICH E6(R2) are appropriate as subcategories for the purpose of monitoring.
        Note: impact â€“ A risk, by its very nature, always has a negative impact. However, the size of the impact varies in terms of categories:
           1.  Well-being/safety of subjects
                A score of 3
           2. Reliability of data
                A score of 2
           3. GCP/protocol compliance
                A score of 1

        Furthermore, the likelihood of the occurrence of such a risk must be decided. Experience values should be used as a basis for the sub-categories, e.g. from overviews of authority inspections of the findings observed. Probability takes a values between 1 and 5.

        In addition, it is important to assess to what extent an existing risk can be detected and possibly minimized by monitoring and, if so, by which monitoring method.
        A basic distinction should be made between onsite and remote monitoring activities and the frequency with which these activities are necessary to minimize/avoid risk. For this reason detectability takes a value of 1 (remote) or 2 (onsite).
